Response JS
===========

[http://responsejs.com](Response JS) is a lightweight, jQuery plugin, that gives designers/devs tools for producing performance-optimized, mobile-first responsive websites. It provides easy-to-use action hooks for dynamically swapping code blocks based on screen sizes and semantic methods for progressively serving images/media via HTML5 data attributes. Response's methods are also available as object properties, making them useful tools in OOP-minded custom development.
